This is a program built using Python (The only programming language I have intermediate understanding of). The goal of this is to make Cloze Cards for Anki (Yes, the spaced repetition software). I coded this with the help of ChatGPT. I am not in any way an expert and I don't have a lot of friends who are quite knowledgeable in programming. This is a personal project, built for a specific goal.

If you ever found this repository, please do say hi. Ask me anything about this program. Maybe we can collaborate to make this customizable and open for everyone using Anki.

Before I forget, this program is for making cards in bulk with the goal of importing it easily in Anki. It's layout looks like "that" famous spreadsheet program but this one is customized to have a Cloze shortcut.
